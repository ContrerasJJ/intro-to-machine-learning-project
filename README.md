# Intro to Machine Learning: Classification Project

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to classify client behavior based on historical data. The goal is to build a predictive model and evaluate its performance using standard machine learning metrics.

---

## 📌 Purpose
Develop a binary classification model to support smarter business decisions by predicting customer outcomes.

---

## 🔧 Methods & Techniques
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Train/test split  
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy  
  - ROC-AUC  
  - Confusion Matrix  

---

## 📊 Results
- Built a supervised learning model with strong predictive performance.  
- Identified key features contributing to prediction accuracy.  
- Achieved reliable accuracy and ROC-AUC scores during evaluation.
